ScHDL: The Scheme Inspired Hardware Description Language
========================================================

ScHDL is a hardware description language that takes inspiration from the
algorithmic programming language Scheme. The language is created with the
following goals:

1. To create a minimal HDL, which only provides NAND and wires out of the box.
2. To allow easy abstraction of hardware-level concepts into nearly algorithmic
   language structures.

The primary intention of this language is to be used in a course, acting as a
replacement to the hardware description language used in the nand2tetris
course.
